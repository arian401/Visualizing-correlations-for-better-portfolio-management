# Visualizing-correlations-for-better-portfolio-management
Using heatmaps to visualize the correlations between stocks.
This code estimates the correlations between stock returns of different companies and visualizes them by using heatmaps.
Correlation coefficient indicates the degree of co-movement of stock returns of two companies, or to what extent the stocks move with each other.
If you want to diversify your portfolio, it’s better to invest a part of your money on the stocks that are not highly correlated with your current stocks. 
By running the code, the dataset gets updated and the analysis is done by using the latest data.
In the list of companies studied here, 'AAL', 'ALK', and 'BA' are highly correlated. 'META', ‘MSFT’, and 'TSLA' are also highly correlated.
You can chenge the list of companies and the time horizin of the dataset.
